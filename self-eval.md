# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt pretty good about the challenge. There are a few parts that probably could have been done more efficiently in Ruby, but it might just be outside of what I currently know. I am pretty sure the way I wrote everything would work in the way that was intended. I think I have a pretty good understanding of object-oriented programming, but this is where the formatting and methods really start changing quite a bit from what I am used to in Java.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I have been able to maintain my focus so far. I just take a 10-15 min break after each section, along with a lunch/dinner break, and I seem to be doing alright.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I think just the formatting of classes in Ruby is something I will have to practice many times before I can remember it quickly. The lack of semicolons at the end of each line has been really easy to screw up.
